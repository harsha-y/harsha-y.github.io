Once I finally got to the point of being able to buy a home and call it my own, the options to automate away all the mundane things seemed limitless.

Alas.

Real life is seldom ideal. A few scenarios I ran into that I'm sure every other homeowner has struggled with.

(Let's exclude "smart" from all of the following topics, I'm sure it is implied)

- [Front Door](front-door.md)
- `TODO` [Home Security System](home-security-system.md)
- `TODO` [Lighting](lighting.md)
- `TODO` [Cooking](cooking.md)
- `TODO` [Audio Visual](audio-visual.md)
