Once I finally got to the point of being able to buy a home and call it my own, the options to automate away all the mundane things seemed limitless.

Alas.

Real life is seldom ideal. A few scenarios I ran into that I'm sure every other homeowner has struggled with.

(Let's exclude "smart" from all of the following topics, I'm sure it is implied)

# Front Door
Went ahead and started researching our (formerly before the nytimes acquisition) trusted friend Wirecutter's [recommendations](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-smart-lock/).

None of the picks hit the mark for my requirements.

I wanted...
- Smart lock with physical key
- Emergency unlock in case of battery failure
- Android support + Nest integration
- Longer than average battery life
- Location based auto lock/unlock

I ended up with one of these [Yale+Nest](https://www.amazon.com/Yale-Security-YRD226-CBA-619-Connected-Touchscreen/dp/B07GQ71KCH?th=1) locaks eventually.

## What went well
- I was able to install the lock with minimal skills
- Worked out of the box
- Excellent android app and voice integration
- Metrics available to HomeAssistant

## What didn't go well
- Installing door ajar module for location based lock/unlock proved much harder than anticipated
- Guest access code creation is a bit clunky
- Probably a front door lock that integrates with the home security system?

## Things I would do differently
- Do I really need physical key access? In the few years I've used this, I have not once used a physical key to gain entry.
- Alternative to 4 AA battery cell driven door lock
